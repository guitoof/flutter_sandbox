// Custom Gesture Recognizer.
// rejectGesture() is overridden. When a gesture is rejected, this is the function that is called. By default, it disposes of the
// Recognizer and runs clean up. However we modified it so that instead the Recognizer is disposed of, it is actually manually added.
// The result is instead you have one Recognizer winning the Arena, you have two. It is a win-win.
